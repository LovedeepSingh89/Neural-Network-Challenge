# Neural-Network-Challenge

**Welcome to my Neural Network Repository**
 
I've created a neural network model that predicts whether start-ups will be successful if funded by a fictitious company

---

## Technologies 

deep neural network, standard scaler, onehotencoder, and function/methods will be used 

---

## Installation Guide
Activate Conda development environement and launch JupyterLab and import the necessary libraries and dependencies

```python
pip install --upgrade tensorflow
```
After installing package, verify Tensorflow and Keras

```python
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.__version__)"
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.keras.__version__)"
```

Alternatively, Google ColabLinks to an external site works well with Tensorflow and can be used to run Jupyter Notebook files.
